## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

To add dependencies to your project, follow these steps:

### 1. **Navigate to your project directory**
Make sure you're in the root directory of your project. You can do this using the command line (Terminal or Command Prompt). 

For example:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

### 2. **Initialize npm in your project (if not done already)**
If you don't have a `package.json` file yet, you can create one by running:
```bash
npm init -y
```
This will generate a `package.json` file with default settings.

### 3. **Install Dependencies**
You can add dependencies to your project using `npm install` (or `npm i` for short). Here are the common dependencies you may need for a project like yours:

#### Example: Install Express
```bash
npm install express
```

This installs the Express.js framework, which is used to build the server.

#### Example: Install Nodemailer (for sending emails)
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

Nodemailer is used for sending emails, such as when the user submits a contact form.

#### Example: Install dotenv (for handling environment variables)
```bash
npm install dotenv
```

`dotenv` is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

#### Example: Install body-parser (for parsing form data)
```bash
npm install body-parser
```

`body-parser` is used to parse incoming request bodies.

#### Example: Install MySQL (if you're using MySQL for your database)
```bash
npm install mysql2
```

This is used for interacting with your MySQL database.

### 4. **Save dependencies to package.json**
By default, `npm install` will add these dependencies to the `dependencies` section of your `package.json` file. You donâ€™t need to do anything extra.

#### Example of `package.json` dependencies section after installing:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.17.1",
  "nodemailer": "^6.6.3",
  "dotenv": "^10.0.0",
  "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
  "mysql2": "^2.3.3"
}
```

### 5. **Reinstall dependencies from `package.json`**
If someone else is working on the project or you need to set up the project again, you can simply run:
```bash
npm install
```

This command will automatically install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
